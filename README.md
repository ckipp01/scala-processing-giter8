# A Scala Processing giter8 template

This is a template to use [Processing 4](https://processing.org/) with Scala and
[scala-cli](https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/). Note that processing 4 is
[*NOT*](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/262#issuecomment-1181918962)
published on Maven Central, so this repo provides both the processing core and
core-sources jars and sets everything up for you.

## Using

To use this template you'll need to make sure you have
[g8](https://www.foundweekends.org/giter8/setup.html) installed, and then just
do the following:

```sh
g8 ckipp01/scala-processing-giter8
```

Once installed, make sure you have [scala-cli](https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/)
installed and run the following:

```sh
scala-cli run -M example .
```

Which should show you the following:
